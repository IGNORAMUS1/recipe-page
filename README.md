### Built with

### What I learned

I learn how to manipulate the marker of listed items and how to change some properties of table using CSS. Also, this make me more curious about if there's conventional way of structuring HTML tags and CSS.

```css
li::marker {
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}

table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to consistently improve my frontend development skills by building to feed my curiousity.
